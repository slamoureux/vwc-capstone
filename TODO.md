# TODO

- update readme
- make sure everything is tabbable and accessible, add aria labels/roles
- connect dev.to API
- add tab to main (blog)

## Maybe

- light mode toggle
- custom 404
- add subheader to contact section?
- and scroll to top arrow component that appears once you start scrolling down
